## What is DOM Property?

- A property is a value that you can get or set value.
- Properties are defined by the DOM. Properties are formed when the browser parses the HTML and generates the DOM.
- Each of the elements in the DOM have their own set of properties which are all set by the browser.
- Some of these properties can have their initial value set by HTML attributes.
- Whenever a DOM property changes which has an influenece on the rendered page, the page will be immediately re rendered.

_ex. Inner HTML_

## What is DOM Method?

Every DOM element has a set of properties when loaded into the browser which are set by the browser. In order to use those properties or get elements from the DOM tree we use functions called methods.

Simply put,

- A method is an action you can do.
- These are basically functions that helps to perform actions like add, delete, access elements in DOM.

_Ex. getElementById()_

## What is Attribute in DOM ?

- Attributes are defined by HTML.
- Attributes are additional information which we can put in the HTML to initialize certain DOM properties.

---

**Attributes X Properties**

- Attributes are refering to additional information of an Element. Properties are describing the characteristics of an Element.

---

### Takeaways:

- Attributes initialize DOM properties and then they are done. Property values can change; attribute values can not.
- The HTML attribute and the DOM property are not the same thing. even when they have the same name.
- For a given DOM node object, properties are the properties of that object, and the attributes are the elements of the attributes property of that object.
